# Habib-Pig-Game
Fully functional Pig game
Rules are as follows:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls 2 dices as many times as he whishes. The result of both dices will get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if any of the player's dices rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- If a player dices come to a total of 6 twice in a row, the player will loose his GLOBAL score and it will be the next playe's turn
- The default target is 69, but can be changed at anytime during the game at the bottom of the screen
- The game is also full proof, once the sum of the "Current" and "Total" score is greater than or equal to the target score, you automaticaly win!
